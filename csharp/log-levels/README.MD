## Instructions

In this exercise you'll be processing log-lines.

Each log line is a string formatted as follows: 
` "[<LEVEL>]: <MESSAGE>". `

There are three different log levels:

- INFO
- WARNING
- ERROR

You have three tasks, each of which will take a log line and ask you to do something with it.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Get message from a log line

Implement the (static) `LogLine.Message()` method to return a log line's message:

```
LogLine.Message("[ERROR]: Invalid operation")
// => "Invalid operation"
````

Any leading or trailing white space should be removed:

```
LogLine.Message("[WARNING]:  Disk almost full\r\n")
// => "Disk almost full"
```

### Task 2: Get log level from a log line

Implement the (static) `LogLine.LogLevel()` method to return a log line's log level, which should be returned in lowercase:

```
LogLine.LogLevel("[ERROR]: Invalid operation")
// => "error"
````

### Task 3: Reformat a log line

Implement the (static) `LogLine.Reformat()` method that reformats the log line, putting the message first and the log level after it in parentheses:

```
LogLine.Reformat("[INFO]: Operation completed")
// => "Operation completed (info)"
````
