## Instructions

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

```
One for name, one for me.
```

Where "name" is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name	|String to return           |
|-------|---------------------------|
|Alice	|One for Alice, one for me. |
|Bob	|One for Bob, one for me.   |
|       |One for you, one for me.   |
|Zaphod	|One for Zaphod, one for me.|
